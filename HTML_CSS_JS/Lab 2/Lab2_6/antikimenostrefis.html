        <h3>Aims and Objectives</h3>

        <p>This course continues developing Object Oriented Programming concepts and principles that have been
            introduced in the course \\\»Algorithms & Programming\\\».
            <br>It aims to provide an extensive understanding of object-oriented programming and the development of
            object-oriented thinking to solve computational and programming problems. Emphasis is given on teaching
            basic principles of object-oriented programming and their application using the JAVA programming language as
            well as understanding the capabilities of JAVA compared with other programming languages.
            <br>It also includes an overview of recursion and other advanced algorithms and techniques.
            <br>Programming is not just writting code. Developers should also make some compromises, to choose among
            alternative designs, different algorithms and different implementations. At the same time they have to deal
            with compatibility issues, performance and reliability and must also satisfy the specifications. Upon
            completion of this course, students should know basic searching and sorting algorithms and also be able to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>develop, transform, verify, correct and execute Java applications using object-oriented features of
                Java
            </li>
            <li>produce object-oriented programs using the basic library of Java</li>
            <li>describe the object-oriented concepts and principles and their implementation using Java</li>
            <li>have knowledge of the hierarchy of Java classes</li>
            <li>use Java classes and derived classes in program development</li>
            <li>judge the quality of other proposed solutions</li>
            <li>co-operate with their fellow students in the joint development and implementation of programming
                solutions
            </li>
        </ul>
